<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This checklist is intended to help with the creation of a data management plan for your project. The data management plan goal is to facilitate the practical implementation of EMBL’s open science policy to promote transparency, auditability and reproducibility of a research project. The data management plan should describe how digital traceability of items that contribute to the output of a project (i.e. reagents, instruments, software and data) will be implemented such that ideally there is an uninterrupted and unambiguous chain of information from reagents to instruments to data to analysis output.</p>
